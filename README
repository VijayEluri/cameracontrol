Camera Control v0.0
-------------------

Camera Control is originally developed to control my Canon EOS 1000D.
It is not intended to be a generic camera control program, but if
people will help me with other cameras, I will use such help to
support more devices.

Supported OS
------------
For now Camera Control supports Linux only. Support for other
operating system may be added in the future depending  on people
help.

JavaUSB 2
---------
Camera Control uses a derivative work of the Java USB programming
library javausb (http://libusbjava.sourceforge.net/wp) named
JavaUSB 2. This is just a modernization of the workinginal library
with few additions needed to better support Camera Control. You
can find more information here http://code.google.com/p/usbjava.
